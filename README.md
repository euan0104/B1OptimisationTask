# B1OptimisationTask
A repo to solve the b1 engineering computation optimisation task

The objective of this practical is to implement and visualize several optimization techniques introduced during
lectures. We will utilize Rosenbrock’s function, as defined in Lecture 2. The submission should include the
charts you create, but you don’t need to submit your code.
