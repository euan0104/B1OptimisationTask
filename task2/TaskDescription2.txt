Next, calculate the gradient and Hessian of Rosenbrock’s function. Find the minimum using gradient descent,
Newton’s method, and the Gauss-Newton method. This should use your own algorithm implementation, ideally
in Python. Execute this code from three different random initializations and update the 2D plot to visualize
the convergence, similar to the one you previously displayed. Each plot should resemble the one in Figure 3.
