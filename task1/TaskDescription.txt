The first task is to visualize the function. Create both 2D and 3D plots that display the function’s values when
sampled uniformly over the interval x ∈ [−2, 2] and y ∈ [−2, 2]. Plot the minimum, which we know to be located
at [1, 1]. Your plot should resemble the one shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively.

f(x, y) = 100(y − x^2)^2 + (1 − x)^2
